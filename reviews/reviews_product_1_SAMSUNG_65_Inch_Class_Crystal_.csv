Jarius spear,the United States,"March 14, 2025",Wait this TV isn‚Äôt $1000+ ?!,5,"Oh how have times have changed! I thought I needed to pay $1000+ to get a tv but I paid less than half of that price for a fantastic TV. If you were to show me this tv I would‚Äôve thought that it was more expensive than the retail price. This is literally the best bang for you buck! Makes you think what‚Äôs the catch, but so far there isn‚Äôt any catch! The black levels are great for a LCD screen. I don‚Äôt see much blooming. The bezels are really thin, makes you think you‚Äôre looking into a portal üò≥ü§£ my wife and I are watching planet earth 2 and it looks SO GOOD. Buy this TV now if you‚Äôre on a budget and looking for a new TV!","['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/7116SWpjIKL._SL1600_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81C0vHvoRKL._SL1600_.jpg']",True,32
"JPF, NJ",the United States,"March 30, 2025",Great Amazon Service & TV,5,"Great TV, great picture & options, very user friendly once you get into the Samsung programs. Amazon process and inside delivery were absolutely fantastic. They delivered to my basement unpackaged the TV, set it in place, removed the packaging & moved my old TV to my garage for disposal & the Great thing I ordered on Friday & they delivered on Saturday..... How do you beat that for customer service? I will always think of Amazon w when ordering anything.",[],True,3
RSB,the United States,"January 20, 2025",First One Arrived Damaged...Second One Is Good...,4,"As mentioned in the headline: The first one had a cracked screen. I ordered the setup delivery, so they took it back and refunded my money. Had I not ordered it I would have had to deal with Amazon for the return. I re-ordered it and they delivered it the next day. This one was not damaged and works as expected. My last TV was 14 years old and I paid well over $1,000 for it. But it gave up the ghost. This TV is so much more... This TV has many apps and features. The picture quality is pretty incredible for this price point. It's well worth the $399. If you have a good internet connection, the numerous apps will provide ample viewing without cable. But if you're inclined to have cable too, all it takes is plugging in an HDMI cable. This doesn't have an Optical Audio Port, but I was able to pair my Vizio Sound Bar with TV's Blue Tooth. I would definitely buy again. There are better TV's out there, but not at this price point.",[],True,59
Michael,the United States,"March 27, 2025",Huge TV!,5,"I bought this to put in our living room, best decision ever! Picture is clear, colors are good, setup was easy. The onscreen guides walk you through the process of connecting your TV to the internet and all attached electronics. The size is perfect for a living room space and looks like we are at the theater. Absolutely love the 85‚Äù screen. It is definitely a two person lift onto the wall mount though. 71 pounds is not that heavy on a regular dead lift however with the size of this tv you can‚Äôt wrap your arms around it and lift. Need one person on each end to lift. Plus the height you have to lift to put it on the wall would be very difficult for one person, that‚Äôs even if one person would be able to grab it in a way to even get it off the ground. I highly recommend this TV. Delivery was awesome and no cracks or damage to the screen.",[],True,5
J. Foster,the United States,"March 4, 2025",READ before DECIDING - Let it break-in/loosen up... INCREDIBLE value!,5,"The picture, after. tweaking to get the look I like on my TVs (not too contrasty most of all) ‚Äî the image quality is STUH. NING. Those saying sound is ok or not great ‚Äî I think a lot of ppl don't give speakers in A/V devices time to break-in and loosen up. Not sure if science backs it up but I've been very picky about sound and visuals all my life ‚Äî and after enough new gear pruchases def noticed that sound always improves after a decent break-in period. So I throw on meditation music on youtube orr spotify, bump up the volume a bit, and just let it play for hours. I can hear the sound on this TV going from sort of plastic boxey low quality and even annoying sounding, to deep, warm and smooth.

This TV is anINSANE value. I don't leave reviews often btw...",[],True,53
jason,the United States,"March 29, 2025",Great buy great price,5,"Easy to set up, picture is amazing, simple to adjust colors, brightness, ect. Only negative is the remote. It's so small, would be nice if they made a large button accessible for older adults. that said great buy great price.",[],True,5
charles p rathbun,the United States,"March 10, 2025",Awesome picture.,5,Worth the money. Setup was a snap. The picture defination is awsome. You can see the eyelash extensions on the ladies. You will need to purchase a compatible sound bar as the installed speakers are weak and not suitable for quality listening. There are many installed features that you need to get acquainted with so you can get the most out of the TV. I highly recommend this Samsung TV.,[],True,13
Susan H.,the United States,"March 10, 2025",Third time is the charm,4,"TV came broken

I guess the saying the third time is the charm is true. I absoulty love the service I got rom the 3rd delivery they set everything up for me and was very sympathetic to my situation. TV works great and my streambnar is amazing.",[],True,9
Lauren Bollen,the United States,"March 10, 2025",Fantastic tv for the price!,4,"I‚Äôve been contemplating on buying a new tv for a while now. My eye sight is hotter so I was having a hard time seeing anything clearly on the 50 inch tv I had in my bedroom. I‚Äôm pretty happy with this purchase. The quality and colors look absolutely amazing, especially on cartoons. The tv was super easy to set up and is surprisingly light for its size. My only complaint (and it‚Äôs totally a personal preference) is that it it does that weird thing where a lot of newer shows look like they filmed them the way soap operas or old British shows were shot. I‚Äôm not sure if you‚Äôll know what I‚Äôm talking about, but I hate that so it‚Äôs taking some time to get used to it.",[],True,2
Vetteracer77,the United States,"January 12, 2025","Initial Samsung 50"" DU7200 Smart TV",4,"Delivery by Amazon seems to be spot on. It was delivered on time with no apparent box damage and no apparent damage to the TV. Now for the not so good; it is not easy to set up and I am electronically proficient. The process to create a Samsung account (which I really did not want to do) in order to use the Smarthub feature is less than intuitive and just a royal pain. Once I completed this process, I moved onto using the Remote to start customizing the picture, sound and adding streaming services. Again, less than intuitive. And speaking of the Remote, I guess Samsung saved .0001 cents by designing a tiny form factor with few buttons which forces every button to have multiple functions which may take me several days to memorize. Now for the good, the picture seems to be excellent, and I have barely scratched the surface of adjustment. Upscaling is very impressive and makes old shows look close to high def quality. Sound quality is good (for my bedroom) but would work best with a soundbar if in a larger room. The bezel around the screen is very acceptable so the actual picture takes up 99% of the screen. One final thing to note, some other review specifically stated the legs are adjustable and could spread different widths. This is most definitely NOT TRUE. There is only one setting which is about 30"" apart for the DU7200 model.
Perhaps in 30 days I will provide another review once I've lived with it a while. I'm hoping this set really shines since ""for the money"", a 50"" 4K Samsung for $325 seems like a very fair deal.",[],True,49
